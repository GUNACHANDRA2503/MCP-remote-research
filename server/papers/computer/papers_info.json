    "summary": "A Human Computer Interface (HCI) System for playing games is designed here for more natural communication with the machines. The system presented here is a vision-based system for detection of long voluntary eye blinks and interpretation of blink patterns for communication between man and machine. This system replaces the mouse with the human face as a new way to interact with the computer. Facial features (nose tip and eyes) are detected and tracked in realtime to use their actions as mouse events. The coordinates and movement of the nose tip in the live video feed are translated to become the coordinates and movement of the mouse pointer on the application. The left or right eye blinks fire left or right mouse click events. The system works with inexpensive USB cameras and runs at a frame rate of 30 frames per second.",

    "summary": "The recently initiated approach called computability logic is a formal theory of interactive computation. See a comprehensive online source on the subject at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html . The present paper contains a soundness and completeness proof for the deductive system CL3 which axiomatizes the most basic first-order fragment of computability logic called the finite-depth, elementary-base fragment. Among the potential application areas for this result are the theory of interactive computation, constructive applied theories, knowledgebase systems, systems for resource-bound planning and action. This paper is self-contained as it reintroduces all relevant definitions as well as main motivations.",
